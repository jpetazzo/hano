Welcome to Hano, your [[http://no.de/|Node.js]] IDE
running on [[http://www.dotcloud.com/|dotCloud]]!

Get started by editing the hello world in [[server.js]].

If you need to install NPM dependencies, edit the [[package.json]] file.

Each time you save:

* your changes are saved as a commit in a Mercurial repository,
* the NPM dependencies taken from [[package.json]] are updated,
* the node process is restarted.

Check your logs! Run {{{dotcloud info hano.www}}} (if you deployed
this app with the name {{{hano}}}) and lookup the port in the {{{log}}}
section. Point your browser to this host+port, and see streaming logs!
You can also stream them live in a console if you use {{{curl}}} instead.

Enjoy!

PS: **Hano** stands for **Ha**tta+**No**de. [[http://hatta-wiki.org/|Hatta]]
is an awesome wiki engine, that uses Mercurial as its storage backend.
Hatta is written in Python, but since dotCloud is a 
[[http://docs.dotcloud.com/services/|polyglot platform]], it can run
both Node and Python at the same time without a hitch.
